<h6>Who we are:</h6>
<p id="cover" class="who">
    Brookhaven Academy was founded in 2012. The vision, interest and commitment of the founder member was a school providing high quality education based on a firm Christian foundation.
    Those charged with responsibility to care for the pupils at the school are also well nourished with the word of God and able to share it with the pupils. Experienced and professional staffs are committed to teaching children as individuals encouraging them to reach their maximum potential. Part of the program involves providing caring discipline.
    We are a mixed Kindergarten and Primary Christian day school offering the 8-4-4 system of education. The kindergarten section has play group classes taking children as young as 2 year olds, while the primary section currently runs up to Standard 4.
